How to run:

In the command line, run python main.py "[FILE NAME]", and it will plot the graph (as long as the chosen file is a viable .json file).

In order to do the testings, just remove the comment from the line "# check()" and it will run all the testings (including the checks on the large graphs so it will take a while).
